Objective	: RFM and Clustering with KMeans from First Question


This project was made using google colab. Library used numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, standardscaler, kmeans, kelbowvisualizer.


First step load the dataset and then do some preprocessing. The next step will be make EDA, unfortunately because of limited time not many EDA I made. Next step will be making new dataframe for RFM and then calculate the RFM score and then decide to make 3 type / segment of customers. Last step will be clustering using KMeans.
